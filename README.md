## Project Description
_commonscore is a minimal smart-contract framework for collective coordination.
It lets groups inside pop-up cities, residencies, or permanent hubs create and join economic agreements that distribute shared costs or benefits automatically ‚Äî with transparency, fairness, and no spreadsheets._



## Tech Stack

- Smart contracts: Solidity (‚â•0.8.20)
- Framework: Hardhat / Foundry
- Libraries: OpenZeppelin (ReentrancyGuard, Ownable, MerkleProof)
- Network: Base / Sepolia
- Membership integration: EAS, Semaphore, Circles adapters (optional)

## Objectives
- Deploy Factory and Agreement contracts
- ETH and ERC20 support
- Participant or amount threshold
- Automatic execution and refunds
- Support + Commons fees

## Weekly Progress

### Week 1 (ends Oct 31)
**Goals:**
Define the idea and achieve alignment within the team. ü´∂



**Progress Summary:**  

Communities like Invisible Garden or Edge City Patagonia often manage shared resources:
- meals and groceries,
- co-working passes,
- local transport,
- common maintenance funds.

commonscore formalizes these informal ‚Äúcommunity pools‚Äù as programmable agreements, deployed on-chain through a factory contract.
Each agreement is a small smart contract that:
- receives contributions (ETH or ERC20),
- enforces a quorum of participants or a funding goal,
- pays out automatically when the conditions are met,
- returns funds if not,
- and fairly rewards the coordinator who managed it.

Optionally, a portion of each successful agreement can be routed to a Commons Vault ‚Äî a shared treasury for permanent hubs.
